Give your brains a racking<br />To find the remedy we're lacking,<br />Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"<br />At this the Mayor and Corporation<br />Quaked with a mighty consternation.

               </p><p>"Come in!"—the Mayor cried, looking bigger:<br />And in did come the strangest figure!<br />His queer long coat from heel to head<br />Was half of yellow and half of red,<br />And he himself was tall and thin,<br />With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,<br />And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin<br />No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,<br />But lips where smile went out and in;<br />There was no guessing his kith and kin:<br />And nobody could enough admire<br />The tall man and his quaint attire.<br />Quoth one: "It's as my great–grandsire,<br />Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,<br />Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!"
